This is an org-mode todo list of stuff that needs to be done for Guile Lua.

* Before inclusion
** DONE And/or evaluate too much
   CLOSED: [2011-04-19 Tue 19:36]
** DONE Standard library functions: math.modf, math.fmod
   CLOSED: [2011-04-21 Thu 15:43]
** TODO Variable arguments and multiple returns
** TODO Use prompt and abort instead of throw and catch
** TODO Standard library function: module
** TODO Standard library function: table.sort
** TODO Get the official Lua 5.1 test suite running

* Eh
** TODO Standard library function: math.frexp
   Pending some additions to Guile's numeric tower.
** TODO Better testing of standard library modules io, os
** TODO Function environments (getfenv and setfenv)

* Differences
  Here are some difference in Guile Lua's behavior that should not cause
  problems in porting Lua code.

** Guile Lua will accept the "break" statement anywhere
   For instance:
   for k,v in table do
     function breaky() break end
   end
   Would be rejected by Lua but not by Guile Lua.

** math.sqrt accepts negative arguments since Guile's numeric tower is capable of representing complex numbers
